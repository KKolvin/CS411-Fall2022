User story 4: Personalized Record: Allergy

As a login user, before inputting ingredients, I want the app to record things that may cause allergies. 
If I donâ€™t have a particular allergy, I can skip this part. 
If I remember I have an allergy to some ingredients later, I hope that I can update my allergy list later. 
Thus, everytime time I look at a recipe that contains ingredients I'm allergic to, there will be a warning showing up for me.
