As a login user, before inputting ingredients, I want the app to record things that may cause allergies. 
If I don’t have a particular allergy, I can skip this part. 
If I remember I have an allergy to some ingredients later, I hope that I can update my allergy list later. 
Then after inputting the ingredients, I want an option for filtering the receipts with the ingredients or seasoning I don’t eat. 
(may just don’t want to eat for today, no need for record)
