User story 5: Save/Favorites
As a login user, I would like to be able to save my favorite recipes where it is easily accessible.  To save my recipes, I would like an option to click a button on the same page as the recipe and have it added to my favorites that I can access later without having to search for it. I would like to be able to click a tab (ex: “Favorites”, “Saved”) and have it show me my saved recipes. I would like to be able to create different folders within my saved recipes so that I can categorize them (ex: “Breakfast”). When I click on a recipe, I want it to take me to that recipe and I want to be able to click back to the folder easily.
