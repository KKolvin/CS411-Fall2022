User Story1: Account Management

As a user, I want to see that there are options for me to register and login by either email and password
  or third party authentication with Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Apple.
I will be asked to provide a primary email address to link to the account if I didnâ€™t provide this information,
  then I can opt in for 2 step verification with the email. 
When I register, I will also provide my answer to a question that I select from the questions being provided. 
After that, I can enable another 2 step verification by answering this question per login in the future. 
If I forget my password, I will be able to receive an email to retrieve my password.
