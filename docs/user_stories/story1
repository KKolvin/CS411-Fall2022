User Story 1: Account Management
  As a user, I want to login by either email and password or third party authentication with Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Apple.
  I will be asked to provide a primary email address to link to the account if I didnâ€™t provide this information.
  When I register, I will also provide my answer to a question that I select from the security questions being provided. 
  After that, I can enable 2 step verification by either email or answering to my security question per login in the future. 
  If I forget my password, I will be able to receive an email to retrieve my password.
